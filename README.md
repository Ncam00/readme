Kia ora, I'm Nixon!

Iâ€™m Nixon, and Iâ€™ve recently transitioned into tech after working in real estate. I completed Dev Academyâ€™s 17-week full-stack bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience building projects in collaborative, fast-paced environments.

I thrive when working with others â€” whether as an Agile Facilitator keeping projects on track, or as a Vibes Watcher making sure the team stays positive and motivated. With a background in real estate and a love for sports, I bring strong communication, empathy, and resilience into every project Iâ€™m part of.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning: React, APIs, and full-stack application design
ðŸ’» Tech stack: JavaScript | TypeScript | React | Node.js | SQL | Git
âš¡ Fun fact: I love sports and bring that same energy for collaboration into coding projects
